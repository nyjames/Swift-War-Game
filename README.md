# Features

* Single-player: Play against the computer.
  
* Random card deck generation: The game uses a shuffled deck of cards.
  
* Simple game logic: The player and the computer draw cards in each round, and the one with the higher card wins the round.
  
* Score tracking: The game keeps track of the number of rounds won by the player and the computer.

# How to Play

1. Game Setup:
   
Upon starting the game, you are assigned a shuffled deck of cards, and the computer is assigned its own shuffled deck.

2. Game Rounds:
   
 * Each round, you and the computer will draw one card from your respective decks.

* The player with the higher card wins the point. In case of a tie, both players draw another card to break the tie.

* The game is infinite and proceeds with each player drawing one card per round.
  

# Technologies Used:
